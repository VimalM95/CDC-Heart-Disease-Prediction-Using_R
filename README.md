In this study, current literatures was heavily researched with it's results discussed in details. This project explores classification across an unbalanced dataset with training performed only on an synthetically balanced dataset. The developed classifier was evaluated on an imbalanced dataset. SMOTE was used as a data balancing technique, followed by development of various classification models. Models were tuned using RandomSearchCV to obtain optimal hyperparameter configurations.
